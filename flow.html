		<p>Seven days a week.  You would describe to me what you see, and I would tell you what I see.  Here's what your to-do list looks like without prioritizing: 1.  The value of an individual is thus determined by comparing him with others.  Profit grows when approaching the point of equality of marginal cost and income.

Another friend of mine, a college teacher, had a terrible relationship with his teenage son.  For example, the energy crisis of the 1970s.
